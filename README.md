## Description of tests:

The tests are divided into API and UI testing parts. 

---
---

## Limitations:
There are limitations for both parts.

First of all, impossible to test actions related to the registration of a new user or actions related to a registered user 
due to the fact that the tested application uses Akamai bot which protects the site from automatic actions on it.

Seconds, I didn't know real endpoints for api part. I used CURLs data from browser.

---
---

## How launch:

### Local:

1. Use JDK 18 Ð¸ Gradle 8.10.
2. Check or fill data for guest.properties and auth.properties. There are needed :

guest.properties:
  mode=GUEST
  baseUrl=https://www.ae.com
  guest.header.authorization=Basic MjBlNDI2OTAtODkzYS00ODAzLTg5ZTctODliZmI0ZWJmMmZlOjVmNDk5NDVhLTdjMTUtNDczNi05NDgxLWU4OGVkYjQwMGNkNg==

 auth.properties (not using due Akamai bot) has data, which to fill:

  mode=AUTH
  auth.username=
  auth.password=
  baseUrl=https://www.ae.com
  guest.header.authorization=Basic MjBlNDI2OTAtODkzYS00ODAzLTg5ZTctODliZmI0ZWJmMmZlOjVmNDk5NDVhLTdjMTUtNDczNi05NDgxLWU4OGVkYjQwMGNkNg==

```bash
# UI tests
./gradlew uiTest -DitemsCount=3

# API tests
./gradlew apiTest -Dmode=GUEST
```

### Due GitHub Actions:

"AE Project" contains GitHub Workflow (`.github/workflows/gradle.yml`):

- launch API and UI tests;
- publishes the Allure report in `gh-pages` brunch;
- manage repository secrets in project;
- ui tests uses GUI mode of browser options with fool window size.

Run workflow:

Go to https://github.com/DevAutoTest/AE_Project
And click "Action" and choose "AE project(API and UI)"

## Allure reports:

### Local:

Execute code in terminal:

```bash

cd ./build
allure serve

```

### Due Git-hub:

All UI+API test results are displayed in Allure Report.
Go to https://github.com/DevAutoTest/AE_Project

On the "Code" page click github-pages in Deployments area:

## Specificities:

- Library org.aeonbits.owner is using to read from property files, system property and env property.
  By default, using property file, than system property.

- -DitemsCount - parameter need for UI part, default = 2 otherwise this is count of items (exmpl: jeans, tops, shorts etc.)
   witch in random mode will be added to bag. Usually not more than 6 items.

- -Dmode=GUEST - parameter need for API part witch may run withowt Akamai bot checking.

- Each ui test is isolated: the browser is restarted before each method (`@beforeEach').
- Each test is performed sequentially, parallel launch  is disabled.
